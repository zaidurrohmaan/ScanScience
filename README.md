# About ScanScience
Everything in this world has scientific facts behind it. Imagine if you could find out interesting science facts about all the objects around you just by taking a photo of them using your smartphone. You photograph water, you will know the science behind water. you photograph dandelions, you will know the science about dandelions. you photograph cats, you will know the science about cats.

This is what my team built as a capstone project at Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka: ScanScience. ScanScience is a mobile application that can make science more interesting and affordable for all levels of society. We aim that this application can increase people's interest, especially Indonesian people, in science. We know that Indonesia's PISA score is still very low, especially in the field of scientific literacy.

However, due to limited time and resources, currently ScanScience can only be used to "scan" objects in the form of animals. In further development, my team will ensure that ScanScience can scan all objects in the world.
